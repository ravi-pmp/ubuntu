1. Basically do a git clone of the repo, cd into the folder and run vagrant up. 
2. The host machine should be preferably a linux box (I use an Ubuntu box). 
3. The host machine should be running the latest version of ansible and virtualbox. 
4. If the machine is not powerful enough, adjust the memory in the Vagrantfile.
